# CurseRatingNeuralNet
Discord bot that rates how cursed an image is using a (poorly) trained neural model

The model is a CNN, more info on CNNs here:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network

Input your API key in the last line of bot.py

The bot assumes you have a Nvidia GPU with cuda cores enabled

Image data is not included because there is just too many to upload to github, be nice to their servers!

# Todo
Add a generative adversarial network to generate cursed/blessed images
